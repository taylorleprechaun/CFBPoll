# CFBPoll

### About

Poll pulls some data about teams and uses it to rank them.  Data used includes game-by-game results and offensive and defensive yardage.  Plans to introduce more/better data in the future.

In the poll, a team's "Score" is in relation to the #1 team.  The formula gives points to teams using the data it has.  Once all the teams are ranked it measures against the highest score given out.  So, if Clemson is #1 and they earned 123 points from the poll, then every team's points will be divided by 123 to get their final score.

Made for fun.  Not really sure what I plan to do with this once I get it refined.
