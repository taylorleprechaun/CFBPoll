# CFBPoll

### About

Poll pulls some data about teams and uses it to rank them.  Data used includes game-by-game results and offensive and defensive yardage.  Plans to introduce more/better data in the future.

In the poll, a team's "Score" is in relation to the #1 team.  The formula gives points to teams using the data it has.  Once all the teams are ranked it measures against the highest score given out.  So, if Clemson is #1 and they earned 123 points from the poll, then every team's points will be divided by 123 to get their final score.

Made for fun.  Not really sure what I plan to do with this once I get it refined.

### Recent changes

* I realized I had been naming the weeks for my polls wrong for this season so far.  This is the Week 6 (not Week 5) poll (and the previous wons for the 2019 season all increase by 1).

### TODO List

1. Score predictor <-- No real progress made here.  Fiddled with it during the offseason but never got anything useful.  Maybe some day...

2. Clean up the code

3. ???
